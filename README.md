# Minimal Headless SPA Demos

The new Visual SPA Editor allows authors to edit your SPA, reducing your ongoing maintenance duties. (win!) But you get to keep everything fully headless.

This demo shows you how to use the basic features for both React and Angular.

## Pages and Components

The demo contains:

- Basic page template
- Contact page template

- Header component
- Paragraph component
- Image component
- List component
- Item component (available inside List component)
- Expander component

- Navigation component

# Now, Get Started for Real!

## Requirements

- Java (JDK)

- [Magnolia CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magnolia/cli) installed ([installation documentation](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Magnolia+CLI+v3))

## Install Magnolia with Magnolia CLI

In a terminal, navigate to the `magnolia` directory and run:

```
mgnl jumpstart -s
```

Choose `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` or `magnolia-dx-core-demo-webapp` as the version to download.

(Magnolia is downloaded.)

## Add the demo light modules to Magnolia

Nothing to do here!
(The Magnolia instance is pre-configured to access the existing 'light-modules' directory.)

## Start Magnolia

From within the `magnolia` start Magnolia with:

```
mgnl start
```

Once the terminal shows `Server startup in X ms`

In your browser, open Magnolia at:

```
http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/
```

## Accessing Magnolia
You can log in to Magnolia using the credentials `superuser/superuser`.
This will give you complete access to all content and configuration.

To access the apps that are mentioned in these instructions use the grid icon at the top of the page, to the right of the search bar.


## Configuring REST and DAM security

### DAM
In order for images to be displayed:
Open the Security app, open the `Roles` tab, edit the `anonymous` role, go to `Web access` tab, `Add new` with this path `/dam/*` set to GET.

### TemplateDefinitions
Open the Security app, open the Roles tab, edit the `rest-anonuymous` role, go to `Web access` tab, `Add new` with this path `/.rest/templateDefinition*` set to GET.
(Note: Only requried for debugging the editor features when running outside the PageEditor.)

### Content endpoint permissions

The app has anonymous access to Magnolia REST endpoints with no additional configuration because:
* "Web access" is allowed, because the restEndpoint files are under the `/delivery` path
* "Access contol list" access is allowed, beause the restEndponts have the `bypassWorkspaceAcls` property.

**NOTE** Allowing anonymous access may not be suitable for a production environment where you wish to keep data private.



# Deploy your SPA to Magnolia

Build and deploy the SPA to Magnolia to make it available for editing.

### React
Go to  `/spa/react-minimal` on the terminal and run `npm run deploy:mgnl`. (You already ran `npm install`, right?)

Once built, check that the app is deployed to `magnolia/light-modules/react-minimal-lm/webresources/build`.

See the `.env` files for important configurations.

### Angular
Go to  `/spa/angular-minimal` on the terminal and run `ng build --prod`. (You already ran `npm install`, right?)
(If you forget the '--prod', the paths to the js and css in the created index.html will be incorrect.)

Once built, check that the app is deployed to `magnolia/light-modules/angular-minimal-lm/webresources/build`.

See the files in `/src/environments` for important configurations.


## Create some sample content

Either import some content, or create it manually.

### Import:

Use the 'Import' action (with nothing selected) and select appropriate file from `/magnolia/_dev/content-to-import/`, either `website.react-minimal.yaml` or `website.angular-minimal.yaml`.

### Manually:

Open the `Pages` app in Magnolia and add either
* A `React: Basic` page and name it `angular-minimal`
* A `Angular: Basic` page and name it `react-minimal`

(The page name is important as the SPA's are hardcoded to treat those names as the base of the app.)

Then add components into the `Main` area of the page.


## Running your SPA in development mode

### React
Build and start the headless React application inside `/spa/react-minimal` by running `npm start`.

### Angular
Build and start the headless Angular application inside `/spa/angular-minimal` by running `ng serve`.








# Additional Information


## CORS set up

Because you installed the `magnolia-community-demo-webapp` bundle, CORS is already configured. Read on to learn how to configure it:
----
By default, Magnolia does not add any [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers to its responses.

However, since Magnolia will be on port 8080 with the React dev server is on port 3000, CORS must be configured.

Magnolia allows you to configure any number of
[Java servlet filters](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html) that can manipulate the HTTP
request/response and with a Magnolia-provided AddHeadersFilter we can set a generic "use anywhere" CORS header for the purpose of this demo.

**NOTE** As with the security config, such a wide-ranging approach to CORS may not be appropriate in production.

The AddHeadersFilter can be configured manually as [described in the documentation](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS61/Filters#Filters-AddingHTTPheaders)
or via the [supplied Groovy script](add-cors-filter.groovy).

## Security set up

By default, the author instance of Magnolia
(see: [Instances](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS61/Instances)) is restricted to authorised users.

For the purpose of this demo, we want to allow anonymous access to the REST endpoint describing the configured content.
(see: [Security](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS61/Security))

The endpoint is http://localhost:8080/magnoliaAuthor/.rest/pages.
Opening this while not logged in will produce the log in page.
